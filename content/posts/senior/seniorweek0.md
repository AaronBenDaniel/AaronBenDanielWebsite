This was my first week back at MHS after summer vacation! Over the summer I did two notable things related to robotics. The first was that Sunk Robotics went to the MATE ROV International Champtionship in Kingsport Tennessee. We had a great time and although we only came in 9th place overall, we came in 3rd place for the proudct demonstration, which in my opinion in the most important.

A month and a half or so after the MATE ROV International Championship, Sunk Robotics was invited to give a demonstration on underwater ROVs for ASLP, a summer camp at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. I and a few other members went and gave a talk and a live demonstration about underwater robotics and our ROV, JONA.

Now, on to things I actually did just this past week! It's been mostly setting and up and settling in. I set up/fixed the FDM 3D printers. One of the Fusion 3s had a broken extruder that I managed to fix. Unfortunately I wasn't able to do any test prints on them as we forgot to order more glue sticks. However, I also set up the Lulzbot printer and that one doesn't need glue. I printed a test print and it worked great!

I also set up the big Tormach CNC Mill. That involved putting in and tramming the vice as well as installing and setting up the automatic tool measurer.

One other thing is that because [Scott Campbell](https://josephscottcampbell.com/) is going on co-op this year, his computer station was available, so I moved there and I've got a new station to work at now.
