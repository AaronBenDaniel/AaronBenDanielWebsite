I spent most of this week working on my Machinist’s Jack project. I spent the first two days attempting to turn the head of the jack, and I almost completed it. However, the threads I made had too high a diameter because I made the assumption that 1/2-13 screws are actually 1/2in wide. This is not the case. I attempted to save what I had made but ultimately had to scrap it. It did serve as a refresher on how to use a lathe, though, as I had very little previous experience using them before.

Wednesday after school I and a number of other team members wrapped our tether. Although I’m still not sure how we’re going to add flotation to it, at the moment I think the tether is in a very good place right now. I also added strain relief to the tether on the ROV’s side. I intend to use the same system on the surface, but need to find one more part before I can finish that.

Wednesday and Thursday I made the base of my Machinist’s Jack. It’s not quite done, with just a little but of facing left to remove the excess material on one side, but other than that this part is done.
