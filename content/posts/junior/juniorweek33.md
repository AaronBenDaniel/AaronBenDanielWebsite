I organized everthing we're planning to bring to the regional, I hope it's everything we'll need. I'll try to pack all of this this into the yellow Pelican case, but I doubt it'll all fit. We might need to use one of the large black cases. Also those are technically still Eben's......

!["Image of the ESC Board"](/img/junior/juniorweek33/board.webp)

I soldered a replacement ESC Board. I hope we won't need it, but the ESCs have been the most unreliable part of JONA and they may break. The motor connectors aren't soldered on yet as the two different ESC boards have different connectors. Those will be soldered on at the regional if we end up needing the board

Mr. Christy also needed me to mill some more parts for him. The ones I did last week were 100mils too small (the holes) so Mr. Christy needed to recut them and have me re-chamfer them.
