On Sunday we got our technical documentation scoresheets back so we were able to review them and edit our Tec Doc for the international competiton. I made quite a few changes and went over them with Zack before integrating them into our doc. I also helped Zack with our budgeting for our trip. It's a very rough estimate, but it looks like this trip will be cheaper than last year, mainly thanks to Tennessee being close enough for us to drive to. Not having to buy flights, train tickets, or bus tickets will *significantly* reduce travel expenses. It also means we won't need to pack JONA into a box.

I also helped to reimage some of our machines in the shop and set up a new laptop for the shop. These items were generously donated by the Toyota Research Institute.

I hope that the Robotics Team will be able to requisition the Thinkpad for next year, as our current club laptop is not great and we've mainly been using Matty's personal laptop for piloting JONA. Matty's laptop works great, but he and his laptop will be gone next year so we need to find a replacement. I'm not too sure if the Thinkpad will actually be better than our current laptop. The new one has a 7th gen i7, and our current one has a 10th gen intel whose category I don't know.
