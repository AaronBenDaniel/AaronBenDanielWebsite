This is my last blog post of my high school career, potentially ever. I'd like to think that I'll continue this website in college, but I suppose only time will tell.

I decided to engrave my name and the shop's logo onto my eccentric staircase. I think it looks good, and now everyone will know that I made it.

Mr. L was talking with Ben and I, and he mentioned that Autodesk will soon(ish) drop Fusion360's support for Windows 10. Unfortunately, this means that the shop will be forced to upgrade all of our computers from Win10 to Win11.

This means that we'll need a new shop image. Ben and I decided to make one and attempt to de-bloat Win11 as best we can.

The big thing that happened this week was the Sophomores' Sumo Bot Contest. I'm a bit disappointed that the robot that ended up winning didn't even work as intended, but overall there was a good showing for this year.

The end of my time in the Robotics & Engineering shop meant that I needed to clean out my box. One of the more major things I still had in there was my Micromouse. I'm still disappointed that I didn't really end up finishing it, but at the same time I don't regret stopping to work on machine shop projects. I left my maze and the robot I built in the shop so that if someone else ever wants to continue it, they'll have everything I've built available to them.
