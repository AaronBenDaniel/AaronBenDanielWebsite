This has been a very lathe-filled week.

!["Image of my Machinist's Jack"](/img/juniorweek21/jacka.webp)

My Machinist’s Jack is complete. It’s….. mostly flat, although it a bit wiggly when fully extended. I might make another so the shop has a set later, but that’s not something I’m going to do soon, I’m done with the lathe for the time being.

Wednesday after school, JONA has its first swim since I redid the ESC PCBs. Although our dumpster is rather small, the test was very promising and I’m very excited for when we can put it in the MHS pool next week. Other than some weights, which I’ll make sometime before 2/7, and a manipulator system (TBD), JONA is done!

Some other small things I did this week include making two pieces for a project of Mr. L’s with the lathe, and helping him (more like hovering over his shoulder while he follows my guide) with the water jet cutter.
