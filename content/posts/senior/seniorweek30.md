I spent quite a bit of time this week prepping for the MATE ROV 2025 New England Regional.

As always, there was quite a bit of important stuff that we got done last-minute, our marketing display included! We got it printed (in one day :O) on Tuesday, which was also the day we finished all the writing for it.

We applied the giant sticker on Wednesday and it came out.... fine. There are a few wrinkles, but I'm sure they'll go unnoticed by everyone but those who applied the sticker.

We get point for having "additional marketing materials" along with our marketing display, so on Thursday I laser-cut some little keychains. They're not the highest quality, but they'll definitely be enough for the judges.

!["The shank"](/img/senior/seniorweek30/shank.webp)

I finished the second-to-last part for the Band Saw Fence. This was the first of the difficult parts that require both turning and milling to make. The shank came out pretty good, although the hole on the top could have the threads go a little deeper. Unfortunately, I'd need to drill it deeper in order to do that, and I wouldn't be confident in the strength of the part if the hole went deeper.

!["The handle"](/img/senior/seniorweek30/handle.webp)

I started the handle and finished the turning portion as well. I discovered that the chamfer tool for the lathe is *not* 45 degrees on both sides, although I feel like the right side is the one with the real 45 degree angle, which doesn't make sense. The chamfers are uneven, but I don't know if anyone would notice without specifically studying them. I'm not too sure why they're uneven like they are, I'd think it'd be the other way around.

The last features I need to cut on the handle will need the mill, and I'll use the collet block in order to hold the part.
