I spent this week building the 50ft tether. Last week I had done the soldering and epoxying, but this week I tied the three cables together, put on the cable sleeve, and attached floatation. The new tether is half as long and will hopefully have significantly less voltage drop. It is also quite a bit more flexible, which might help with it getting tangled and bent. In additition to installing the new tether, I cleaned the cart and reorganized everything. It is now in tip-top shape. It was rather impressive how much gunk had accumulated on it, especially the top part that gets more wet.

The new tether has three of my epoxy jobs on it, unlike our old tether which had one of mine and two of the huge and ~~horrible~~ bulky blocks of epoxy. It honestly didn't matter much, but in my heart I care.

I believe that Sunk Robotics is ready for the International Competition in Kingsport Tennessee.
