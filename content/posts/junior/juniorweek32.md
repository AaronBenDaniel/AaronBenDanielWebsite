I spent this week assembling the new Power Distribution Board V3. This new board features an isolated 5V power system which should hopefully eliminate the ground noise caused by the ESCs that were interfering with the 5V system.

I haven't actually tested the board yet, other than the voltage regulating features, as I haven't had time, and by the time that I do, it'll be quicker to just put it in JONA and see if it works. Other than rebinding the motors, it should just be a drop-in replacement.

Mr. Christy also asked me to mill a chamfer on a part he water-jet cut, so I did that too.
