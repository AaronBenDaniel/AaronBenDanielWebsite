It’s my first week back at school and it only lasted 10 hours. Two days on extended advisory and then a four day weekend. Honestly, I like having a short week and then a long weekend to ease back into school, it makes the transition smoother.

I am now a junior in the Robotics & Engineering vocational shop, but I’ll only spent two periods in it (4 & 5) as I have English 6th period. I would normally have shop three periods (4, 5, 6) but I wanted to take Physics in my junior year, which means I need to drop one period of robotics to fit everything into my schedule.

Because I’m a junior, for robotics I’ll now need to create a website (and here it is) and start filling out goal sheets. I’ve heard goal sheets are…. less than popular, but they don’t sound too bad. I guess I’ll see. My website is a thing that exists now, some of my classmates wanted me to create my own without using WordPress or Wix or other website creation services, but I don’t want to write my own website, honestly.

Sunk Robotics’ first meeting was on Thursday, a promising new member, Miles, made an appearance. He is a freshman that already has experience in programming, 3D modelling, and 3D printing. Hopefully he can become a valuable member of the team. Next week I’ll start fixing our old ROV so that it can be used for practice, but then I’ll begin working on building the electronics for our new ROV.
