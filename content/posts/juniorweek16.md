This week was, again, quite slow. I’m once again waiting on my two main projects, so I’ve been doing some smaller robotics team things and continuing to work on my water jet guide.

On Wednesday I cut off all of the super high-gauge motor cable extensions are replaced them with lower-gauge ones. These should not be points of failure like the previous ones might have been.

Thursday I soldered our new ethernet cable onto its Blue Trail Engineering connector. This new ethernet cable is stranded, so it’s far more flexible than our old one. This new ethernet cable has not yet been potted.

In addition to soldering the motor cable extensions, I helped {{< linknewtab "https://miloaustin8.wixsite.com/themiloaustin" "Milo Austin" >}} operate the water jet as he was cutting a hole in a ceramic tile of the Construction shop. This was the first time I’d cut in a super brittle material like ceramic and I certainly learned some important things about the water jet in the process.

Throughout the week, whenever I didn’t have anything else to do, I was working on my water jet guide. I’d say it’s about halfway done as of 2023-12-21. I do wonder how much it’ll actually get used, as I know I wouldn’t want to learn how to use the water jet just from a guide. I’d want an actual person to teach me.
