I spent this week mostly working on Sunk Robotics' Technical Documentation and other related documents in preparation for the upcoming MATE ROV New England Regional. Last year, Zack Bertocchi used Adobe InDesign to create our Tech Doc, but he didn't save the design files, and none of know how to use that software. Because of this, we needed to recreate our Tech Doc from scratch and we opted to use Google Docs to do this.

I was rather skeptical at first, not believing that Google Docs was powerful enough to make something that looked good, but I was pleasantly surprised. Buried deep within submenus and internet searches, Google Docs actually has a reasonably fleshed out formatting system that has the ability to make something pretty good looking.

As part of my efforts this year to prepare the younger members of the team for Ben and my's imminent departure (and a case of Senioritis), I've had them do most of the writing for this year's doc. I've looked over most of it, and while I probably would have written it differently, I think it'll be fine.

In addition to the Tech Doc, there are a number of other documents that we are required to submit prior to the competition. One of these is the Company Spec Sheet, which I was tasked with creating. I mostly followed the design of last year, but once again had to completely remake it from scratch, this time in Google Sheets.

We still need to take a Team Photo as we completely forgot that's a thing we need, so we'll need to take that tomorrow.

I only got a little bit of work done on the Band Saw Fence this week. I began the turning process for the Shank, although I didn't get too far.
