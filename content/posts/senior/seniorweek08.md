While I did do some work on my Micromouse this week, I spent a majority of it in the machine shop helping the sophomores with their Turner's Cubes. There are three pairs of sophomores (one for each mill) currently making their Cubes and I've been supervising/teaching them how to use the mills along with Mr. L.

It's probably going to take a while for the sophomores to finish their cubes, if all of them even want to. This first batch of students is looking to take over a week to go from cut-stock to finished cubes, so I'm not sure how long it's going to take for *all* the sophomores to finish.

The work I did this week on my Micromouse was pretty uneventful. I built a breadboard version of my circuit boards to confirm the electronics will work together. I also made an unfortunate discovery: The super small ToF sensors that I wanted to use are apparently a slightly different type that is less accurate than the other (larger) ones I had tested with. While I probably could still use the smaller ones, I'd really prefer the extra precision and have changed my circuit boards to use the older, larger ToF sensors.
