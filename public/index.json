[{"content":"On Monday I tested the feasibility of re-programming the ESCs to change the startup melody to \u0026ldquo;Shipping Up To Boston\u0026rdquo;. I need to use the website esc-configurator.com because the official BLHeli software doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow for reprogramming the startup melodies for 8-bit ESCs (which the Blue Robotics ESCs are). I have so far been able to change the startup melody, but the re-programmed ESCs don\u0026rsquo;t function yet. I only worked on this on Monday, as the new Power Distribution Boards arrived on Tuesday.\nI spent Tuesday soldering and debugging the 2.5V voltage reference for the ADC. It is by far the smallest component I\u0026rsquo;ve ever soldered and I ended up using the hot plate to solder it, as the hot air gun would blow the part away even on it\u0026rsquo;s lowest air setting.\nOn Wednesday I began soldering on the other components, and after school Shane and I discovered that the ADC has it\u0026rsquo;s own voltage reference and no VREF pin\u0026hellip; So the voltage reference on the PCB is useless.\nWe also discovered that the ROV is broken. During the process of once more reducing votlage drop, something broke and I2C stopped working. I think that the problem is with the 9-axs IMU, but I am not 100% sure and need to do some additional debugging.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek24/","summary":"The new Power Distribution Board has begun assembly, also the ROV broke :(","title":"Junior Week 24"},{"content":"This week I designed the Power Distribution Board V2. Last Wednesday, it was made clear that there is a serious problem with the 5V system on JONA ROV. With the help of Mr. Christy’s friend, Shane, I did some diagnosing, but I’m still not 100% sure what the cause of the problem is. It’s probably due to insufficient current supply, as our current 5V regulator can only supply up to 3A. Anyone who has read the electrical specifications of Raspberry Pis should know that this is not enough, and we always knew that 3A was insufficient, but we’re only just now having a problem with it.\nThe new PD Board will have an 8A voltage regulator as well as current and voltage monitoring capabilities.\nI’m still not 100% sure that the new voltage regulator will fix our problems, but I have no idea what the source of the issue could be if it isn’t the current supply. Even still, having a greater maximum current draw is good, and I continue to learn more about PCB design.\nI believe the new board is done and ready to be ordered, but I still have the nagging feeling that I’m missing something. I intend to ignore it, though, as I have felt this way every single time I’ve ordered PCBs from a PCB company and haven’t forgotten anything yet.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek23/","summary":"The Power Distribution Board V2 is… ready to be ordered?","title":"Junior Week 23"},{"content":"This week was rather slow, as I was between projects and was doing a number of quick and small tasks.\nThe main exciting thing that happened this week was that JONA finally got to take a swim in the pool. Unfortunately, the rear camera didn’t work due to a corrupted SD card (which might be due to a hard power-off or just a bad card) and there were… technical difficulties that led to the IMU not working during our testing. The IMU issue is fixed now, but that meant that we couldn’t test rotational PID this week.\nThe RPi4 is having power issues. I thought that I had solved this issue by decreasing the resistance in the 5V power systems, but the problem has reappeared. I don’t think that it is begin caused by the same source, though, this time. There is very little voltage drop, not enough to be causing this issue. I believe that out voltage regulator simply cannot supply enough current to power the 5V system. Unfortunately, I can’t accurately measure the current consumption of the ROV, as the Shop doesn’t have any tools to measure quick current spikes, which I believe to be the problem.\nI haven’t confirmed the actual cause of the ROV’s problems, and am betting that it’s due to insufficient current supply. If increasing the available current still doesn’t solve the issue… I don’t know what I’ll do.\nI also started designing a mechanical gripper for the ROV. I only did the very basic mechanical design before I handed it off to a prospective new member. Alex Pilika is a sophomore in the Robotics \u0026amp; Engineering shop and has expressed interest in joining the team. He has said that he will attempt to design a gripper, but honestly, I’m doubtful that it’ll actually get done in a reasonable amount of time. I guess I’ll see in the next week or so.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek22/","summary":"JONA has taken it’s first real swim!

It’s….. mostly flat, although it a bit wiggly when fully extended. I might make another so the shop has a set later, but that’s not something I’m going to do soon, I’m done with the lathe for the time being.\nWednesday after school, JONA has its first swim since I redid the ESC PCBs. Although our dumpster is rather small, the test was very promising and I’m very excited for when we can put it in the MHS pool next week. Other than some weights, which I’ll make sometime before 2/7, and a manipulator system (TBD), JONA is done!\nSome other small things I did this week include making two pieces for a project of Mr. L’s with the lathe, and helping him (more like hovering over his shoulder while he follows my guide) with the water jet cutter.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek21/","summary":"My Machinist’s Jack is done!","title":"Junior Week 21"},{"content":"I spent most of this week working on my Machinist’s Jack project. I spent the first two days attempting to turn the head of the jack, and I almost completed it. However, the threads I made had too high a diameter because I made the assumption that 1/2-13 screws are actually 1/2in wide. This is not the case. I attempted to save what I had made but ultimately had to scrap it. It did serve as a refresher on how to use a lathe, though, as I had very little previous experience using them before.\nWednesday after school I and a number of other team members wrapped our tether. Although I’m still not sure how we’re going to add flotation to it, at the moment I think the tether is in a very good place right now. I also added strain relief to the tether on the ROV’s side. I intend to use the same system on the surface, but need to find one more part before I can finish that.\nWednesday and Thursday I made the base of my Machinist’s Jack. It’s not quite done, with just a little but of facing left to remove the excess material on one side, but other than that this part is done.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek20/","summary":"I am about half way done with my Machinist’s Jack","title":"Junior Week 20"},{"content":"This week has marked the end of my major contributions to the robotics team.

With that fixed, JONA ROV is now fully functional and can begin pool testing.\nI tested my water jet guide with the help of juniors Tanzerul Azam and William Tseng. My water jet guide is now complete. It is available here.\nWith all of the projects I’d been devoting most of my time to complete, I now have almost nothing to do in the shop. This means that I can start a new project, or more specifically, re-start an old one. At the very end of my Sophomore year, I began designing and manufacturing some machinists jacks. My first attempt did not end well, but I believe that, with the knowledge I gained from my first attempt, I can successfully manufacture them this time.

All four worked, so I then soldered the XT30 connectors onto the remaining four motors. I was able to assemble everything and JONA ROV is now, theoretically, fully functional. Wednesday after school Matty was able to test each motor and they all work! However, we also discovered another problem. There is a very mysterious voltage drop in the 5V system that I have no idea how it even exists. When I measure voltage from two points on a continuous power bus, I read two different values.\nGiven all of the knowledge I have of electrical engineering, this should be impossible. I will need to seek help from some more experienced people in order to solve this problem. This voltage drop is (I believe) responsible for instability in the electrical system and results in the RPi4 not behaving properly. In addition to the voltage drop, we may be over-currenting our voltage regulator, although I am doubtful that we are.\nI also began mounting the rear camera. I was having problems with it earlier, but they appear to have disappeared.

The very last day of school before Christmas Break, the ESC PCB V2s arrived. This week I have begun assembling them. Their updated design allowed the ESCs to fit more flush against the PCB and makes surface-mount soldering them with solder paste easier.\nI have found a good method for soldering the ESC to these PCBs. I first add just enough solder paste to make a connection, soldering everything together, and then add more solder with a soldering iron and solder wire. This method has so far been consistent and I have one full ESC PCB V2 assembled.\nOn Thursday I soldered the male XT30 connectors onto the thruster wires and soldered a female XT30 connector onto the power connector. I plugged everything together and the four thrusters connected to the new PCB successfully played the startup sound. I unfortunately am unable to actually drive the motors via the Raspberry Pi 4 without Matty, so they haven’t been tested all together yet.

These should not be points of failure like the previous ones might have been.\nThursday I soldered our new ethernet cable onto its Blue Trail Engineering connector. This new ethernet cable is stranded, so it’s far more flexible than our old one. This new ethernet cable has not yet been potted.\nIn addition to soldering the motor cable extensions, I helped Milo Austin operate the water jet as he was cutting a hole in a ceramic tile of the Construction shop. This was the first time I’d cut in a super brittle material like ceramic and I certainly learned some important things about the water jet in the process.\nThroughout the week, whenever I didn’t have anything else to do, I was working on my water jet guide. I’d say it’s about halfway done as of 2023-12-21. I do wonder how much it’ll actually get used, as I know I wouldn’t want to learn how to use the water jet just from a guide.

January 27-28, MATE will be hosted an event to educate teachers about the MATE ROV competition, with the intent of starting more teams in the New England area. Sunk Robotics was invited to speak about our experience in the competition, and about how we got started as a MATE ROV team.

I had thought that the 80/20 we had came pre-threaded, as the 80/20 on S.T.E.V.E. was threaded, but apparently the stuff I used was not. I tapped the parts of 80/20 that needed screws through them. In the process of assembling the model, I noticed that some holes had not been cut, and I found out that I had forgotten to model them in the 3D model. I also ran out of the screws I’ll use to assemble the frame, so I ordered more of them.\nBuilding a cardboard model of the ROV was definitely a good idea, it reassured me that everything would work the way I wanted, and helped me discover some mistakes in my 3D model. Unfortunately, the interlocking tabs can’t be tested in cardboard, as they’re dependent on the thickness of the material, and cardboard is significantly thicker than the 1/8in aluminum the final frame will be made out of.\nRecorded by Ben Wirz\nI began cutting the final metal frame out of aluminum with the Water-Jet Cutter. It was fixed just this Monday, and I finally got to learn how to use it! It wasn’t too difficult, as it is similar to many of the other CNC machines I’ve used before such as the Plasma Cutter and CNC Router. The Water-Jet was broken for most (if not all) of last year, and I’d been waiting for an opportunity to use it for a long time.

I took this time to begin writing documentation for everything I’ve done so far. MATE requires extensive documentation of the process of building our ROV. I’ve so far written a fair amount about the Frame, Electronics Enclosure, Camera System, and Thrusters. The following is an excerpt from what I wrote about JONA ROV’s thrusters.\n“We decided to design our own thrusters guards, although we were heavily influenced by UWROV’s design. Our thrusters guards meet the IP-20 requirements of the MATE ROV competition but cause the minimum impedance of water through our Blue Robotics T200 thrusters. This allows us to make use of as much of the force our thrusters generate as possible while still maintaining the standard of safety required of us.”\nOn Wednesday the ESC PCBs I ordered arrived! They arrived super quickly, far quicker than we expected, although this turned out to be a bad thing. The reason the PCBs arrived so fast was because they were green. We thought we ordered black PCBs, which take longer to make, but for some reason we got green ones instead. Regardless, the color is aesthetic only, and has no impact on the functionality of the board.\nMr. Christy and I attempted to solder a Blue Robotics ESC to one of the boards, but the solder paste Mr. Christy had did not work. We’re unsure as to why, but the solder paste melted almost instantly (suspiciously quickly) and it was far too runny. It didn’t wick onto the solder pads and we decided not to attempt any further soldering until we had new solder paste. The solder paste we used was 6 years old, but I’m unsure how long it takes the kind we used to expire.\nThursday I soldered all of the connectors onto one of the ESC PCBs. We’re going to need two of them in the end, so we can test soldering ESCs onto another board and we can use the one I soldered today once we have perfected the process.\nOur 6 inch tube also came in on Wednesday!

It’s probably my least favorite part of the MATE ROV competition, but I do understand how important it is in the real world, and for future members of Sunk Robotics.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek07/","summary":"I made a camera, also ordered some PCBs","title":"Junior Week 07"},{"content":" This was a short week, as Monday was Columbus/Indigenous Peoples Day.\nThis week I received a response from Shane, Mr. Christy’s “PCB guy”. He had looked over all of the PCBs we have for our new ROV so far and pointed out some flaws that I would not have noticed myself. For example: wires getting caught on plastic structural clamps of some connectors and connecting the signal-ground pads to the ground-plane. I believe that the signal-ground pads and the power-ground pads are connected inside the ESCs, but better safe than sorry.\nI also began modeling the hardware for the new ROV frame. I believe I have a final design for the parts of the frame itself, but I still need to plan out how each part will connect together. I’d kept this in mind when designing it, so I already mostly know how everything will connect, but I still need to actually model all the nuts, bolts, and washers, as well as putting in all the holes for them.\nOn Thursday, at Mr. Christy’s recommendation, I spoke with Matthew Stricker, a sophomore in the shop, about building some new Tube Cameras for the robotics team. Because we’re building a whole new ROV, but keeping our old one, we need more cameras for it. I could build them myself, but I already have quite a bit to do, so I could use the help. I prepared all of the manufacturing documents he’ll need, but I don’t believe he knows how to use most of the machines the process will use. I would teach him, but the whole point of him doing it is that I’m not… I’m sure he’ll be able to find someone else to teach him. I hope.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek06/","summary":"Turns out there are a lot of screws on the ROV…","title":"Junior Week 06"},{"content":"This week, the primary thing I’ve been working on has been a prototype PCB frame for the Robotics Team’s new ROV.\nI laser-cut a bunch or parts and cut some lengths of threaded metal rod. I then assembled everything, which took a while because I needed to thread 44 M3 nuts onto the long threaded rod. This whole process took two days.\nWednesday after school, I taught Miles Hillard, a prospective new member, how to design PCBs in Fusion 360. He had previous PCB design experience, although not with Fusion. He definitely needs more practice, but I believe he will eventually become an adept PCB designer.\nThursday I tested our 4-wire ethernet plan, and I can confirm that only the green and orange twisted pairs are required to 100mb/s ethernet.

I’m quite disappointed that my CNC engraved idea didn’t work out. I ended up just spray painting the metal sheet and then laser-engraving the text into it. The upside to this method is that I can do solid shapes and logos, instead of just lines.\nAfter I finished up the plaque, I got back to work on the new electronics enclosure. Our new design will hopefully be far cleaner, easier to modify, and will also look a lot cooler. Our main tube (6in diameter) will have a frame with a bunch of slots on it, and a bunch of PCBs will go into each slot and be connected together with as few wires as possible. This week I designed two PCBs: the Power Distribution Board, and the I2C \u0026amp; Power Bus Board.\nThe Power Distribution Board splits the incoming 12V for use in the two ESC Boards, and for the 12V to 5V converter on the PCB. The Power Distribution Board also has the 12 Channel PWM Controller for the ESCs, as it is the closest board to the ESC boards and the extra space.\nThe I2C \u0026amp; Power Bus Board has a 6-port I2C bus and a 4-port 5V power bus. This board is not full size, and will go on a clear acrylic piece that fill fit into the electronics frame. This acrylic piece will also hold the Raspberry Pi 4B and a 9-axis IMU.\nWhile writing this blog post I thought of a much better way to do the I2C \u0026amp; Power Bus Board, so I’m gonna completely remake it Friday.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek04/","summary":"The plaque is done!

I had to reduce the width by one inch in order to make it fit in the stock we had. I also reduced the length by 1.5 inches so that the aspect ratio would remain the same.\nThe routing went exceptionally smooth, and was finished quite quickly. I then cleaned everything up and sanded all the surfaces down.\nTuesday I stained the wooden part of the Watts Water Plaque with Light Brown stain. I also started on the metal bit. I plasma cut a rectangle of 1/8in aluminum sheet metal, deburred it, and began polishing it. A combination of Brasso polishing compound, fine steel wool, and the polishing wheel gave the best finish of the (numerous) methods I tested.\nWednesday, I finished up polishing the aluminum sheet, engraved it, and with the help of Ben Wirz, applying some paint and sanding it to make the letters contrast more.\nThis is mostly what the plaque looked like before the paint treatment.\nThis is the plaque after the paint. It does look better, but it is highly lighting dependent. In some conditions it looks great, and in some it’s completely unreadable. I am considering remaking the metal portion of the plaque and instead laser-engraving painted aluminum, it might look better.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek03/","summary":"Staining, engraving, and finishing the Watts Water Plaque","title":"Junior Week 03"},{"content":" On Monday I tested out the engraving method I will use for the plaque I’m making for Watts Water Technologies. I used a diamond-drag engraving bit in the Tormach to CNC engrave some text (the words “Lanky Giraffe” were provided by Tanzy). The above engraving involved three engraving passes for each character offset 0.01 inches. The text came out very good and I believe I will continue to use this method for all my future engraving. I also was curious to see what the text would look like when sandblasted. The answer is not too good.\nBefore facing\nAfter facing\nIn order to cut the wooden portion of the Watts Gift, I need to use the CNC router. I have had some experience with the machine, but I am definitely not confident with it yet. However, before the router can be used at all this year, the MDF board on it must be flat. It could either be replaced, or it could be faced down so that it’s flat again. I decided to try facing it down, and this involved creating a CNC program to have the router run over the entire board with a 3 inch diameter wood facing bit.\nThe program did not end up facing the entire board, with ~.25 in of board left over. I didn’t measure or zero the board or machine…. in any precise way, so this was expected. I manually faced the remaining bit by jogging the machine with the spindle active. Once the board was completely flat, I removed all of the old tape and retaped the board with the assistance of Tanzy.\nI have written a CAM program to route the wooden part of the Watts Gift, but I haven’t cut it yet (as of Thursday).\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek02/","summary":"Engraving testing and facing the router.","title":"Junior Week 02"},{"content":"This week I had two main goals: Fix S.T.E.V.E. ROV and refine the ESC PCB I designed for the Robotics Team’s new ROV. I originally planned on starting to design a power distribution board this week, but I realized that the ESC PCB I had made was in serious need of some cleaning up. My top priority this week was fixing S.T.E.V.E.\nIt turns out, though, that fixing S.T.E.V.E. wouldn’t take very long. I am proud to say I could give the ROV a shining “It works!” after only five minutes of fixing. The primary reason for this is that our lead programmer’s (and pilot) computer was having “issues”. When we first plugging the ROV in a week ago, we couldn’t connect to it, but it wasn’t because of anything wrong with the ROV. This is because there was nothing wrong with the ROV. I spend all of five minutes plugging it in, scanning it’s IPs, and verifying that everything works perfectly fine. Our programmer couldn’t connect to it because his computer apparently spontaneously breaks and he didn’t realize this was the case.\nI spend almost all of Wednesday re-finding some parts on Digikey that I intend to use on the ESC PCB. A while ago I had downloaded some 3D models and have been using them in my PCB design, but I never saved the part ID. Without the part ID, I can’t actually buy these parts, so it’s pretty important. I had to search through Digikey in order to find the exact parts I was using while not knowing the specific details of each component such as Pitch or Contact Finish. I did eventually find the parts, though.\nAs I said, these parts would be used on the ESC PCB I’ve been working on. This past week, I added the signal connector, which I had not done yet, added groundplane on both sides of the PCB, and moved some on the connectors. The groundplane was a recommendation by Shane, someone introduced by Mr. Christy who is giving me advice on PCB design. The groundplane should hopefully isolate the signal traces from the high-frequency pulsing of the ESC output traces. Without it the signal might have too much interference and it wouldn’t work.\nThe silkscreen I added is not technically required, but it’s free with PCBWay and it will make my PCBs look almost professional. It will also help with assembly. Fusion 360’s way of doing silkscreens is kind of horrible, as I can’t directly edit the silkscreen of the PCB, I can only edit it for individual parts. I’ll have to come up with a solution to add some text to the PCB that isn’t for a specific part.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/posts/juniorweek01/","summary":"S.T.E.V.E. is working and my great PCB adventure continues.","title":"Junior Week 01"},{"content":"It’s my first week back at school and it only lasted 10 hours. Two days on extended advisory and then a four day weekend. Honestly, I like having a short week and then a long weekend to ease back into school, it makes the transition smoother.\nI am now a junior in the Robotics \u0026amp; Engineering vocational shop, but I’ll only spent two periods in it (4 \u0026amp; 5) as I have English 6th period. I would normally have shop three periods (4, 5, 6) but I wanted to take Physics in my junior year, which means I need to drop one period of robotics to fit everything into my schedule.\nBecause I’m a junior, for robotics I’ll now need to create a website (and here it is) and start filling out goal sheets. I’ve heard goal sheets are…. less than popular, but they don’t sound too bad. I guess I’ll see. My website is a thing that exists now, some of my classmates wanted me to create my own without using WordPress or Wix or other website creation services, but I don’t want to write my own website, honestly.\nSunk Robotics’ first meeting was on Thursday, a promising new member, Miles, made an appearance. He is a freshman that already has experience in programming, 3D modelling, and 3D printing. Hopefully he can become a valuable member of the team.

Named Sunk Robotics, we participate in the Ranger class of the MATE ROV Competition. The MATE ROV Competition is an international underwater robotics competition that challenges students of all ages to build, operate, and speak about underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Sunk Robotics participates in the Ranger class, which is for high school-age teams. And have advanced to the international level twice (2022 \u0026amp; 2023).\nI primarily help with building and maintaining the hardware of our robot. I worked on the electrical and camera systems for our 2022 \u0026amp; 2023 ROV, S.T.EV.E. (pictured above). Currently, I’m working on the frame, electrical, and camera systems of our 2024 ROV, JONA.\nAlmost all of my in-shop time is spent working on something related to Sunk Robotics.\nProjects from Sunk Robotics: 2023-2024 JONA ROV Frame - FUNCTIONAL: For our 2023-2024 year, Sunk Robotics decided to build an entirely new ROV Frame. The major reason for this was to increase our thruster count from 6 to 8. The additional thrusters will allow for far greater lift capacity and pitch control. As of January 2024, the frame is functional but lacks a few finishing touches.\nSee posts about the JONA ROV Frame\nJONA ROV Electronics Enclosure – UNDER REVISION: For our 2023-2024 year, the Robotics Team decided to switch from a 4in tube to a 6in tube. Redesigning the frame was the perfect opportunity to do this. Changing the size of our tube required a design of our electronics system. We wanted to transition away from a literally wooden plank and instead wanted a cleaner and more professional solution. Our new design features a frame that holds up to 6 custom PCBs. This new design is far cleaner than our previous design, much more reliable, and looks… safer. This project is now complete, although small changes and additions may be made in the future, its core functionality is done.\nSee posts about the JONA ROV Electronics Enclosure\nWatts Water Plaque: Our biggest cooperate sponsor, Watts Water Technologies, has continually supported Sunk Robotics, and we felt the need to express our appreciation. I took on the task of designing a gift for them and decided on a plaque that could have text engraved on it.\nSee posts about the Watts Water Plaque\nTube Camera – The Single Cable: During our 2022-2023 year, although the Tube Cameras worked well, the way they had two separate wires for each one was a big hassle and a major point of failure. I revised the way they’re connected to the Main Electronics Tube and have combined both 5V power and 100Mbps ethernet into a single CAT 5E cable. The Tube Cameras never utilized the full 1Gbps they were wired with on S.T.E.V.E. I repurposed the unused twisted pairs into 5V power and GND.\nSee posts about JONA ROV\u0026#39;s cameras\n2022-2023 Tube Camera: During our 2022-2023 year, we made two major improvements to S.T.E.V.E.: The gripper, and the camera system. I focused on cameras for almost the entirety of the year and designed a multitude of cameras, but ultimately we decided one standard camera design was best. I focused my attention on the best design I’d made, which was the Tube Camera. The Bottom Camera was, for many reasons, a bad design, but the worst aspect of it was how long it took to disassemble and reassemble. The fasteners used to attach the face plate took a very long time to put together. This made maintenance very difficult. The Tube Camera, however, utilizes a custom O-ring seal instead of fasteners. This drastically reduced the time it took to put together, and was a major improvement. It was also far smaller, so it could feasibly be mounted facing forward and backward instead of exclusively down. The Tube Camera is (as of October 2023) still in use on JONA ROV.\n2021-2022 Electronics Tray: I designed the electronics tray for S.T.E.V.E. ROV, which would be used from 2021-2023. The tray contained all of the electronics (other than the external Bottom Camera) for the ROV. Being made from laser-cut 1/4in plywood, it was very adaptable, as new holes could easily be drilled without disassembling the entire thing.\nBottom Camera: After the 2021 regional, we realized that we needed a bottom-facing camera. I was tasked with making this bottom camera. I was not very experienced and decided to create a waterproof housing around a camera design I’d already made and implemented. This solution was very inefficient and clunky, but it did work.\nLight: During our first year, before we had actually attended any competitions, we weren’t quite sure what the lighting conditions of the pools we’d be competing in would be. We decided to add a light to the front of the ROV so that we’d be able to see in low-light conditions. We quickly realized that we’d only be competing in well-lit environments and decided not to use the light as it could only cause additional problems and we did not require it. This was my first contribution to the Robotics Team.\nThe Sumo Bot Project All sophomores in the Robotics \u0026amp; Engineering vocational shop participate in the Sumo Bot Competition. Students are broken up into teams of 1-2 people and they have a few weeks to build a sumo bot to compete. My partner, Tanzerul Azam, and I formed \u0026ldquo;Team Nestle\u0026rdquo; and built a sumo bot.\nThe Lightbox Project Left-to-right: Scott Campbell (’25), Tanzerul Azam (’25), Nate Matarazzo (’25), Aaron BenDaniel (’25).\nAll sophomores in the Robotics \u0026amp; Engineering vocational shop are tasked to build lightboxes during the second quarter of their year. I decided to build a wooden ellipsoid lightbox. It has a hexagonal display that features the face of one of my classmates, Tanzerul Azam. The lightbox can be controlled using the switch and potentiometer on the sides.\nMy lightbox has a variety of display modes:\nSolid color (#000000 to #FFFFFF) Random Color Rainbow Strobe Metal Head Near the end of my sophomore year in the Robotics \u0026amp; Engineering shop, I wanted to learn more about our Tormach PCNC 1100 4th axis extension. I decided that I wanted to mill a complex 3D object and settled on a portrait bust of a human head. This project is (as of October 2023) the most complex 4th-axis milling project in the shop.\nDead Tool Rack After I broke a 1/2″ flat-end mill, I wanted to create a place to put other broken milling tools. I cut a bunch of holes into some aluminum angle bracket and designed a holder template to be 3D printed for each bit to be held in. I haven’t made holders for quite a few things that are sitting on it…. I should make them at some point.\nMetal Die Before I started on my Metal Head project, one of my Robotics teachers, Noah Lewkowitz (Mr. L) asked me if I wanted to finish a project he had started. Mr. L had begun to work on a metal six-sided die, and I decided to finish it. The die honestly isn’t that great and I have a few modifications I would make if I milled another one, but at the moment I do not have plans to make another one. Maybe I’ll eventually mill a whole RPG dice set, but that’s a plan for the future.\n","permalink":"https://aaronbendaniel.netlify.com/projects/","summary":"Sunk Robotics Left-to-Right: Matthew Harris (’24), Aaron BenDaniel (’25), Timothy Hunt (’27), Franklin Soto-Ortiz (\u0026lsquo;24), Zachary Bertocchi (’24), Noah Gibson (’24), Jonas Wirz (\u0026lsquo;27), Scott Campbell (\u0026lsquo;25), Samuel Christy (Mentor), Ben Wirz (\u0026lsquo;25), Benjamin Santanna (\u0026lsquo;24), Matthew Stricker (\u0026lsquo;26), Miles Hilliard (\u0026lsquo;27).\nJONA ROV, Sunk Robotics\u0026rsquo; newest edition to its fleet\nI am a founding member of the Medford Robotics Team.
