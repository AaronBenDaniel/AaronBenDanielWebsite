I spent all of this week cutting parts for the JONA ROV frame. Everyone had Tuesday off, but Mr. L offered to let me come to the shop. {{< linknewtab "https://benwirz.netlify.app/" "Ben Wirz" >}} and I were in the shop from 8am-2pm on Tuesday and got quite a bit done. We successfully soldered a full ESC PCB. I tested each ESC (individually, not all together) and they all work! The second ESC PCB has been less straightforward, but I’m confident we can get it to work quickly. (Ben has been doing most of the ESC PCB work now, I just helped him for the first one)

The big thing I worked on this week was the JONA ROV frame. On Wednesday I finished cutting everything and assembled the frame! I believe the frame is ready for MITRE (By the way, the robotics team was invited to the opening ceremony of {{< linknewtab "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/20/business/bluetech-economy/" "MITRE’s giant tank" >}}) There’s still work to be done on it, such as coloring it, but for now I can call it “done”. Next week will be all about the electronics for JONA. I hope JONA ROV will be fully functional by the 20th (The MITRE Tank Opening Ceremony)
