This week I started a new project: a Bandsaw Fence. I've finished the preliminary CAD design, which is admittedly a bit overcomplicated, but frankly this entire project is just another excuse to manufacture stuff, so I guess that's all the better.

The idea for this project came from Mr. L, who suggested that I make a Band Saw Fence, as we definitely need one. Up until now, we've just been clamping a piece of angle stock to the table, which is not great and is not always parallel to the blade.

After I finished modelling, I decided to 3D print everything first in order to confirm that my design isn't completely awful. Unfortunately, this postpones my project at least a day while I wait for the parts to finish.

The other main thing I did this week was catalog all the endmills that we got from Venca. Ben Wirz and I had already looked through this drawer, but we weren't really remembering what we saw, only taking a cursory glance.

This time, I went through every label and added it to the spreadsheet. I didn't look at every individual endmill, but the drawer was already mostly sorted, so I just took note of what labels were there. There's quite and array of tooling, and I hope that robotics will be able to take (as opposed to borrowing when needed) some of the tools.
