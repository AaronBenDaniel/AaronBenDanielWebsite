The first three days of this week were spent finishing up the Bike Holder for Metal Fab. I think it turned out pretty good.

It fits the pipe perfectly and the Metal Fab teachers were quite impressed with it. We didn't have bolts long enough for it, but Metal Fab should be able to buy some easily enough.

With the Bike Holder done, I had nothing to do. However, Ben Wirz was using the Tormach and noted how the ATC is missing a couple parts. Right now, our "12-pocket" ATC only holds 10 tools because we're missing some parts for it. We could buy them, and while price isn't really a concern, I looked and they were $47 each!

These parts are required to hold the tools in each ATC pocket, and while we probably could have 3D printed them, they'd most likely break and drop a tool eventually. We could easily enough mill them ourselves so that's what I set out to do.

I did most of the CAM for it on Wednesday, and started milling the first one on Thursday. It so far looks good, but I still need to do the second setup to see if the part will actually work.
