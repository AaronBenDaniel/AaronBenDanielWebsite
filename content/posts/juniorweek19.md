This week has marked the end of my major contributions to the robotics team. Although I will of course continue to help, my two main projects are now complete.

On Wednesday, Mr. Christy’s friend Shane helped fix the voltage drop that was causing instability in JONA ROV’s 5V systems. With that fixed, JONA ROV is now fully functional and can begin pool testing.

I tested my water jet guide with the help of juniors {{< linknewtab "https://tazam257.wixsite.com/tanzerul-azam" "Tanzerul Azam" >}} and {{< linknewtab "https://willvictor82.wordpress.com/" "William Tseng" >}}. My water jet guide is now complete. It is available {{< linknewtab "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Ct_nLgRmGJVEYIGeXUzbjGuyYpuIFuorEzUfgsBD80/edit?usp=sharing" "here" >}}.

With all of the projects I’d been devoting most of my time to complete, I now have almost nothing to do in the shop. This means that I can start a new project, or more specifically, re-start an old one. At the very end of my Sophomore year, I began designing and manufacturing some machinists jacks. My first attempt did not end well, but I believe that, with the knowledge I gained from my first attempt, I can successfully manufacture them this time. I just started to turn the first one on Thursday, and I predict this project will take at minimum all of next week.
