I finally finished the Sound Bend Lathe ways cover! I'm still missing some M10 nuts, but the thing stays in (mostly) without them for now. This should hopefully keeps stuff from dirtying up the ways of the lathe, and I it looks  pretty great.

I had already done the carriage end last week, but this week I made another bracket and designed and made a mounting part to attach the bracket to. Manufacturing the parts took two whole days, as our waterjet is currently broken so I had to get Metal Fab to cut the basic shapes and then I needed to manually drill all the holes. The waterjet could have cut the outline and holes in one go and done it *far far* faster.

I also got to test out the bearing I finished on Friday last week. I ended up finishing the bearing right at the end of the day on Friday, and had to wait until Monday to actually test it. It works fantastic and should hopefully make aligning the tool post much less annoying. I still have a second backup bearing, so I might end up making another one for the Trak Lathe, although it uses some different hardware, so I'd need to change my design a bit.

Here's a video of it working, narrated by your's truly.

I also spent a bit of time on Monday and Tuesday helping Mr. L with git and hugo. He didn't have much experience with either and asked for some help while making his own blog using Hugo. He has chosen to use PaperMod, which is the same Hugo theme I use.

I also started setting up a selfhosted Wordpress instance for the Robotics Team's website.
