I milled two more parts for the Band Saw Fence this week. This marks the completion of the clamps.

All that remains now, is also the most difficult part.

The shank and handle parts which will fit together to form the part that the user turns and compresses the pusher to clamp the Fence to the band saw table are the most complex parts of this project.

Both parts will involve both turning and milling.

In addition to my work on the Band Saw Fence, I also spent a bit of time with Mrs. Miller in the Programming and Web Development shop trying to get the Sunk Robotics website finally up and running with Bluehost, the service that Programming uses to host all of their websites. It was a real struggle to get the domain [sunkrobotics.com](https://sunkrobotics.com) to finally connect to the Bluehost instance, but we finally did it!

Another thing that needs to get done before the MATE ROV New England regional is getting new Sunk Robotics shirts. Our current shirts were made way back in 2022 for our trip to Long Beach, California. In addition to the outdated sponsors and logo, we simply don't have enough shirts for everyone. All the members who have graduated have taken their shirts with them, so we needed to order additional shirts.

The shirts will feature our new logo and an updated sponsors list.

(The shade of blue is random, the white parts will be printed onto blue shirts.)
