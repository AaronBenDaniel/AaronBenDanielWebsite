This week, the primary thing I’ve been working on has been a prototype PCB frame for the Robotics Team’s new ROV.

I laser-cut a bunch or parts and cut some lengths of threaded metal rod. I then assembled everything, which took a while because I needed to thread 44 M3 nuts onto the long threaded rod. This whole process took two days.

Wednesday after school, I taught Miles Hillard, a prospective new member, how to design PCBs in Fusion 360. He had previous PCB design experience, although not with Fusion. He definitely needs more practice, but I believe he will eventually become an adept PCB designer.

Thursday I tested our 4-wire ethernet plan, and I can confirm that only the green and orange twisted pairs are required to 100mb/s ethernet. I made an image to reference so I won’t forget how our CAT 5E cables need to be crimped.

Friday the Robotics & Engineering shop goes on a field trip to {{< linknewtab "https://tulip.co/" "Tulip Interfaces" >}}, so I will not be able to complete any work that day.
