This week was a mostly mundane week. The Robotics Team did finally name our 2024 ROV, though. It’s name is…. JONA ROV! We couldn’t decide between JOE and TINA, so we made a comprise. (The ROV is not named after the MHS junior Jonah Siegal)

I designed and built a fisheye camera mount for the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3. Wednesday, Matty tried to test it, but something was wrong with the software so he wasn’t able to. The plan is for this camera module to go on the front of JONA ROV inside the electronics tube.

I finally have begun the process of actually making the PCBs, after some last-minute changes, the ESC board has been ordered. We’re starting with just the ESC board, so any issues that might be present on all of the boards I’ve made will only require one set of board to be reordered, instead of all of them. We ordered our boards from {{< linknewtab "https://jlcpcb.com" "JLCPCB" >}}.

I’ve begun writing the documentation for 2024. It’s probably my least favorite part of the MATE ROV competition, but I do understand how important it is in the real world, and for future members of Sunk Robotics.
