(Late because at first I didn’t even intend to write this, but I didn’t want to be missing a week so here it is)

The only really notable thing that happened this (very short) week was the robotics trip to MITRE. We missed periods 3-6 and attended the opening ceremony of MITRE’s Blue Tech Lab. There were a bunch of important people there, including Under Secretary Spinrad of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

We were also invited to another event that’s going to be hosted at MITRE. January 27-28, MATE will be hosted an event to educate teachers about the MATE ROV competition, with the intent of starting more teams in the New England area. Sunk Robotics was invited to speak about our experience in the competition, and about how we got started as a MATE ROV team. We have yet to decide who will go, as I doubt they really want us to bring the whole team. Personally, I think we should bring a maximum of four people.
