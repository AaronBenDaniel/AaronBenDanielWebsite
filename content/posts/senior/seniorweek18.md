This week I got quite a bit of work done, but at the same time it feels like I didn't get as much as I'd have liked. On my goal sheet, I was rather optimistic about my timeline for this project and thought I'd be able to have it completed by Friday. Suffice it to say, this will not happen. Even if I didn't end up needing to remake the holder, there was no way I'd have been able to get everything done.

### Tuesday

On Tuesday I turned the threads on the body of my Tap Follower. They were... not fantastic. I didn't make a trough for me to stop threading as I was concerned about the wall thickness. Because of this, the ends of the threads are inconsistent and overall not great. However, I expect that they will still work just fine and that it's purely cosmetic.

In addition to the threads on Tuesday, I also drilled the 1/2in hole in the body. It took quite a while, as I needed to doing a "pecking" operation to avoid clogging up the drill bit with chips. This significantly slows down the process and it ended up taking me almost a whole day. I also ended up misjudging the depth of the drilling operation and ended up needing to do multiple operations because, after I finished the first one, I realized that it wasn't deep enough and there was more material inside of the piece than I had predicted.

On the bright side, this showed firsthand one of the big advantages of using a collet chuck. Even though I took the piece out and put it back in, it was still perfectly concentric. Additionally, though it's important to note I'm working with steel and not aluminum, there were no marks on the parts from the chuck and the surface finish was unblemished.

By the end of Tuesday, I finished the body. I think it turned out about as good as I could have expected. It's defiantly smaller that I expected when I was designing it in Fusion. I'm a bit concerned that it'll be *too* small, but for smaller threads, which it most of what we're making, I hope it will be enough.

### Wednesday

!["Image of the bad holder"](/img/senior/seniorweek18/failure.webp)

On Wednesday I got to work on the holder, which is the part of the Tap Follower that compresses the spring and provides a method to hold the tool. The primary feature of the holder is a 3/4in circular extrusion intended to be held by a Tormach ER32 collet. Tormach collets can be held by our Tormach mills and our Trak with an adapter we have. However, We won't be able to hold the Tap Follower in a lathe tailstock as we do not have a Tormach to Morse Taper adapter.

Luckily, I plan to make one. It won't clamp down on the Tormach collets, so they'll just pull out and will freely rotate, but for tools that are pushed into the taper and are fine rotating (like my Tap Follower), this adapter I plan to make will enable me to mount my Tap Follower in all of our mills and lathes.

!["Image of the three-jaw chuck"](/img/senior/seniorweek18/jaws.webp)

Because the maximum outer diameter of the holder is 1.125in (changed from the drawing I made), I need stock greater than one inch in diameter. The next largest steel stock we have is 1.3in, which is too big to fit in the collet chuck. Luckily, it's quite easy to swap between the two chucks and I learned how to do so.

!["Image of the parting tool I used"](/img/senior/seniorweek18/blade.webp)

Unfortunately, in the process of parting off the holder, I'm not quite sure what happened, I was probably just going to fast or not using enough oil, there was a *THUNK* and that's never a good sound to hear when turning.

I immediately stopped the parting operation and inspected the part and tool. The part was fine, but the parting blade was mangled. Interestingly, the blade looked mangled *UP*. Which is quite weird, as the material was moving *down* the blade. I'm not really sure how that could have happened. I unfortunately did not take a picture of the blade before I fixed it.
