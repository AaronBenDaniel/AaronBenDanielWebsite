This week was short, but I did get some important things done. I modeled and test-printed the custom gearing for the side of my Micromouse that needs on offset motor. I wasn't sure if the resin printers would be able to print such small teeth, especially for helical gears, but the gears appear to be correct.

They spin together smoothly, but I got the hole diameter wrong on the wheel, so I had to drill it out and now it wobbles. I'll need to print a new version with the correct hole diameter.

This is the piece that will hold the geared wheel, it's quite small and I'm really appreciating just how tiny my Micrmouse is going to be.

This piece was also printed on the Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro printer [Alex Pilika](https://core2engineering.wordpress.com/) brought in last year. Despite having been in the shop since last year, the printer was only just now set up. So far, it seems to be inconsistent, but when it prints well, it's the best FDM printer in the shop.
